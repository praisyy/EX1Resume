<h2 id="A1"><b>Career Objective</b></h2>
    <p>A Career Objective or a Resume Objective is essentially a heading statement that describes your
        professional goals in two to three sentences. Employers looking to hire an employee for a position tend
        to seek candidates that are driven enough to understand what they want.</p><br>

<h2 id="E1"><b>My Internships</b></h2>
<h3>Infosys</h3>
<p> &emsp;&emsp;This was a remote internship I did at Infosys, an automation company in Noida.</p>

<h3>Microsoft</h3>
<p> &emsp;&emsp;For my internship, I had to make an ML algorithm to segment Stomach, Large Intestine and Small Intestine in such a way such that 
    the cancer rays do not affect those organs.</p>

<h3>CISCO</h3>
<p> &emsp;&emsp;The 3-months Summer Internship Program at ICISCO is a vital part of the 4-year Btech Course. Since majority of the students come without any prior work experience, the Summer Internship
    adds worth to their CVs by giving each student immense learning</p>
    
<h3>Oracle</h3>
<p> &emsp;&emsp;I was hired for only Project Hope, however after a week of my joining; I was absorbed for another
    project - Oracle Development</p>
